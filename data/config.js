  ruleFacts: [
    "City-wide Stage 4 outdoor water restrictions took effect November 4, 2026, while the new Bearspaw South Feeder Main is connected (about four weeks). No end date has been announced. Commissioning in December is not expected to need restrictions.",
    "The city must keep water use below 500 million litres (ML) per day (green zone). Above 500 ML is the red zone: risk of not enough water for firefighting, low pressure, a possible boil water advisory, or system failure.",
    "During the shutdown, Glenmore Water Treatment Plant supplies about 80% of the water and Bearspaw about 20%.",
    "NOT allowed under Stage 4: watering lawns, gardens, trees and shrubs by any method (including new grass/plants); outdoor ice or snow making including flooding rinks; washing cars with driveway or street water; washing sidewalks, driveways, walkways, outdoor parkades, building surfaces or windows (health and safety exceptions); construction or renovation water use; testing irrigation systems; filling fountains or decorative water features; filling outdoor pools, hot tubs or wading pools.",
    "ALLOWED any day, any time: washing cars at indoor car washes (only when needed for safety is encouraged); watering edible food crops with a spring-loaded hose nozzle or hand-held container; watering plants for commercial sale or donation; water for livestock; bird baths and residential ponds. Indoor pools may operate.",
    "Indoor asks: keep showers to about 3 minutes (each minute saved can save up to 8 L); shower every two days; keep baths shallow; full loads only for washing machines and dishwashers; use eco settings; flush only when needed (skipping five flushes saves about 25 L); turn off the tap while lathering, brushing teeth or shaving; turn off water softeners and humidifiers; fix leaks.",
    "City water-use figures: front-load washer 62 L per cycle, top-load 112 L; dishwasher 28 L per load; low-flow toilet 4.8 L, standard toilet 6 L per flush; regular shower head 47.5 L per 5 minutes, low-flow 38 L; typical bath 92 L.",
    "Violations may result in fines starting at $3,000. Questions: 311.",
    "Frozen pipes: the City advises keeping the heat at 15°C or higher and opening cabinet doors near pipes. Homes that had frozen pipes before, or that received a City letter, may be asked to keep a pencil-thin stream of water running.",
    "Alberta's electricity grid peaks between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. During cold snaps, AESO asks people to avoid running dishwashers and laundry in that window.",
    "DropWise runs a weekly Quadrant Water Challenge (NW, NE, SW, SE): households share their daily litres per person from water-meter readings; the quadrant with the lowest average wins. Discord members can type e.g. 'NW 165' in #water-challenge.",
